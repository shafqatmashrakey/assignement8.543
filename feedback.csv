Eric Miguel,Using web technologies to make three different password strength checkers,4,8,More cats :),Absolutely :)
Brianna Lopez ,"This project develops a password checking web apps using gameplay elements to see if making security education interactive improves the adoption of strong, unique passwords.",4,8,I suggest providing the source code for the implementations. Also providing feedback of your experience. Any challenges or recommendations for others who may attempt to replicate this. ,Shared The source code on the github.Working with Svelte with no experience was challanging as well as coming up with the whole idea
Jay Estiva ,Project 1 topic focuses on informing the audience about poor password usage and creates a game to test potential password strength. The first implementation focuses on the password checker. The second implementation focuses on the explanation. The third implementation focuses on a contact page. ,3,8,"As an alternative, you can incorporate a number score for the password. Also, what about something for us dog owners? As an alternative, you can incorporate a number score for the password. Also, what about something for us dog owners? ",liked the idea and definitely will do something with dogs in future.
Wilkenson Hilarion ,As cybersecurity threats continue to rise a major contributing factor is poor passwords among regular internet users including weak reused and compromised passwords,4,7,"good job, maybe give users a number to look at say, out of 10, 10 being the most secure. 1 being the less secure. ",Instead of giving scores I wanted to check out the rules to encourage users to use stronger password but definitely will try to implement the score system in future.
