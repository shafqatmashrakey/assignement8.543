    <h1>
        The average CMMI maturity level and NASA Technology Readiness Level of Project 1
    </h1><br>
    <p>
        Based on the feedback : <br>
        The average CMMI maturity level of Project 1 is
        3.75 <br>
        The average NASA Technology Readiness Level is
        7.75 <br>
        It seems that the project is generally in a good state of maturity and readiness. The average CMMI maturity level of 3.75 suggests that the project has well-defined processes and also with an average NASA TRL of 7.75, the project's technologies are approaching a state where they are nearly ready for operational use, with only minor integration or testing remaining.

        The current US-CERT 3-2-1 Data Backup status of the CSC 543 portfolio.
    </h1><br>
    <p>
        The CSC 543 portfolio's US-CERT 3-2-1 Data Backup status is good. Backups are stored in three places: OneDrive, GitHub, and a local drive.

    <h1> One or more paths to optimizing the CSC 543 portfolio US-CERT 3-2-1 Data Backup status.</h1><br>
    <p>
        To optimize the CSC 543 portfolio's US-CERT 3-2-1 Data Backup status, one path is to automate backups. This means using software to regularly save data to OneDrive, GitHub, and a local drive. Also, it's important to check backups regularly to make sure they work. Another way is to use a portfolio platform for resumes, which could offer better organization and access to my work.

    <h1>
        The current NIST CSF2 PR.DS compliance (PR.DS-01, PR.DS-02, PR.DS-10, PR.DS-11) of the CSC 543 portfolio.
    </h1><br>
    <p>
        The current NIST CSF2 PR.DS compliance of the CSC 543 portfolio involves ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data at rest (PR.DS-01), data in transit (PR.DS-02), and data in use (PR.DS-10). Additionally, backups of data are created, protected, maintained, and tested (PR.DS-11).
        <br><br>
        My current methodology for backing up the CSC 543 portfolio partially satisfies NIST CSF2 PR.DS requirements. 
        Storing backups on OneDrive, GitHub, and a local drive aligns with protecting data at rest (PR.DS-01) and backup creation (PR.DS-11).
        However, additional measures may be needed for data in transit (PR.DS-02) and data in use (PR.DS-10) compliance, such as ensuring secure transfers and protecting data during access.

    <h1>One or more paths to optimizing NIST CSF2 PR.DS compliance of the CSC 543 portfolio.</h1><br>

    <p>
        I believe  regularly reviewing and updating backup procedures to ensure they meet compliance requirements can further enhance PR.DS-11 compliance.
